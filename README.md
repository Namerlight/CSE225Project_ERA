# CSE225Project_ERA

For NSU CSE215 (Java) Project. Built in Maven using Java and JavaFX. 

Essentially, an app to provide the user with tutorials and reference material for various topics. Login Screen is kinda redundant considering the features currently present, but an expanded version would've had 'favourites' and saving specific materials. Task for another year, anyway.
