       ----------Data Types in C++----------


They are used to define type of variables and contents used. Data types define the way you use storage in the programs you write. 
Data types can be built in or abstract. Built in Data Types These are the data types which are predefined and are wired directly into 
the compiler. eg: int, char etc.

User defined or Abstract data types
These are the type, that user creates as a class. In C++ these are classes where as in C it was implemented by structures.

Basic Built in types
char	for character storage ( 1 byte )
int	for integral number ( 2 bytes )
float	single precision floating point ( 4 bytes )
double	double precision floating point numbers ( 8 bytes )
Example :

char a = 'A';          // character type
int a = 1;             // integer type
float a = 3.14159;     // floating point type 
double a = 6e-4;       // double type (e is for exponential)
Other Built in types

bool	Boolean ( True or False )
void	Without any Value
wchar_t	Wide Character

Enum as Data type
Enumerated type declares a new type-name and a sequence of value containing identifiers which has values starting from 0 and 
incrementing by 1 every time.

For Example :

enum day(mon, tues, wed, thurs, fri) d;
Here an enumeration of days is defined with variable d. mon will hold value 0, tue will have 1 and so on. We can also 
explicitly assign values, like, enum day(mon, tue=7, wed);. Here, mon will be 0, tue is assigned 7, so wed will have value 8.
